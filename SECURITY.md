## Reporting a Vulnerability

All data and bot services are protected by authentication and access is limited to a small subset of users (developers and, for some data, Suggester Staff members). If you believe you have found a security issue in one of our systems, do **not** post in a public chat. DM a Developer (`Brightness#0001` or `Ben!#0002`) on Discord with information and we will investigate.
